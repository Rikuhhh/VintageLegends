About the Project

VintageLegends is a personal creative project developed by me, a student and independent developer. It combines retro game aesthetics with modern AI-assisted
tools. While AI support was used during the creation process, the project was fully directed and assembled by hand.

This is a non-commercial work made out of passion for classic game design and nostalgia.

Monetization

Because AI assistance was used, this project will not be monetized. It exists purely as a creative and experimental work.

However, if you wish to support me and my future projects, there will be options to do so.
